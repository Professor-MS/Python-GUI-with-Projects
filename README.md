# 🖥️ Python GUI Projects

A comprehensive collection of **Python GUI applications and mini-projects** built using **Tkinter**, **CustomTkinter**, **PyQt6**, and other Python modules.  
This repository is designed to help learners and developers understand GUI programming in Python through practical, hands-on examples.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains multiple Python scripts, each demonstrating a specific concept, widget, or project related to graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  
It is ideal for **beginners and intermediate Python learners** who want to learn GUI development, event-driven programming, and building complete applications with real-world functionality.

## 🧩 Frameworks and Libraries Used

- **Tkinter** – Python’s standard GUI library for creating windows, labels, buttons, and layouts.  
- **CustomTkinter** – Modern, visually appealing extension of Tkinter for custom widgets and themes.  
- **PyQt6** – Used in selected projects for advanced cross-platform GUI applications.  
- **Pillow (PIL)** – For image handling, manipulation, and displaying graphics.  
- **Random, Math, Datetime, OS** – For logic, calculations, file handling, and date/time management.

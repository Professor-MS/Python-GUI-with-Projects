# 🖥️ Python-GUI-with-Projects

A comprehensive collection of **Python GUI applications and mini-projects** built using **Tkinter**, **CustomTkinter**, and **PyQt6**.  
This repository is designed to help learners and developers understand GUI programming in Python through practical, real-world examples.

---

## 📘 Overview

Each script in this repository demonstrates a specific concept, widget, or project related to building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.  
The goal is to make GUI development **simple, educational, and hands-on** for beginners and intermediate learners.

## 🧩 Frameworks and Libraries Used

- **Tkinter** – Python’s standard GUI library for creating windows, buttons, labels, and layouts.  
- **CustomTkinter** – A modern and customizable extension of Tkinter for visually appealing designs.  
- **PyQt6** – Used in some examples for building advanced, cross-platform GUI applications.  
- **Pillow (PIL)** – For image handling and manipulation.  
- **Random, Math, Datetime, and OS modules** – Used where needed for logic and functionality.
